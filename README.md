# The Native Speaker 🎯

A pronunciation tool born from a personal experience at my college convocation, where the mispronunciation of my name turned what should have been a moment of pride into a utter embarrassment. This tool aims to ensure no one else has to experience such a moment during their important events.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The Native Speaker helps speakers, hosts, and presenters correctly pronounce names and words from different cultures. Whether you're a conference host, or anyone who meets and greets people of different cultures ,this tool is designed to make pronunciation accessible and accurate.

## 💡 Motivation

As a VLSI engineer from India, the defining moment that inspired this project came during my college convocation. When my name "Samriddh K. Singh" was called out incorrectly, it wasn't just a minor mistake - it was a moment that diminished the celebration of years of hard work. This personal experience highlighted a broader issue faced by many in our increasingly global community.
